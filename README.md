# Decision Tree Implementation using ID3 Algorithm (Python)

This repository contains a Python implementation of Decision Trees using the ID3 algorithm from scratch.

## Datasets

Two datasets are utilized in this project:

### Heart Dataset

The Heart Dataset consists of 76 attributes, with published experiments commonly referring to a subset of 14 attributes. The Cleveland database, containing integer-valued "goal" fields ranging from 0 to 4, is primarily used by machine learning researchers. The goal field indicates the presence and severity of heart disease.

### Glass Dataset

The Glass Dataset, sourced from the UCI repository, includes 10 attributes such as id and others. The response variable is the glass type, which is discrete and can take seven values.

## Project Tasks

The following tasks have been undertaken in this project:

1. **Data Transformation:**
   - Both datasets are transformed into a discrete state, ensuring compatibility with the ID3 algorithm.

2. **Data Splitting:**
   - Each dataset is split into training and testing sets. Seventy percent of the data is allocated for training, while the remaining 30% is designated for testing.

3. **Decision Tree Construction:**
   - A decision tree is created using the ID3 algorithm.

4. **Accuracy Reporting:**
   - The accuracy of the model is reported on the test data for both the Heart and Glass datasets.
