# ID3-Algorithm
Python implementation of Decision trees using ID3 algorithm from Scratch.
  
Two datasets are provided for this project .I used these data sources for this Project
Heart Dataset: This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.
In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field
indicates heart disease. It is integer-valued from 0 to 4.
Glass Dataset: This is a Glass Identification dataset from UCI. It contains 10 attributes including id, etc. The response is
glass type (discrete 7 values).

I have done the following in this project:
1- Transform the datasets into a discrete state.
2- Split each dataset to train and test parts. Consider 70% of the data as training data and 30% as testing data.
3- Create a decision tree.
4- Report the accuracy of the test data in both datasets.
